Algorithm:
    The program will loop waiting for input from the user. Upon getting input it will check the string against any 
    known built in commands, and if one is found it will be executed. If not it will be passed to a function on the 
    assumption that it is a system command and willl tried to be executed there.

Assumptions:
    I am assuming that if the user is redirecting file input or output they will actually name a file following the
    chevron on the command line.

How to Run:
    Make sure that make is installed on the system.
    Navigate to the directory and type Make.
    Ignore the warnings that appear on screen.
    Type ./msh on the command line to run the shell
    Typing exit will quit, args will print the number of arguments and what they are
    add will add any number of numbers together and print the result to the screen
    cd changes the current working directory provided the destination exits
    tictac will start a game of tictactoe on the screen. The game is designed to be played by 2 people
